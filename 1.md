## 1. Variables and Declarations
1. Create a variable `name` and store your name in it. Print it.
2. Create variables `age` and `city`. Print them in a sentence.
3. What happens if you declare a variable but don’t assign a value?
4. Change the value of a variable after declaring it. Print both values.
5. Use `let`, `const`, and `var` to declare variables. What differences do you notice?

## 2. Data Types and Type System
1. Create variables of type: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, object.
2. Use `typeof` to check the type of each variable.
3. Add a string and a number together. What is the result?
4. Convert a number to a string using `String()`. Print the type.
5. Convert a string to a number using `Number()`. Print the type.
6. What is the result of `null + 5`? Why?

## 3. Operators
1. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
2. Use `%` operator to find remainder of 17 ÷ 5.
3. Use `++` and `--` on a number. Print before and after.
4. Compare two numbers using `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
5. Compare `"5" == 5` and `"5" === 5`. What’s the difference?
6. Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) in examples.

## 4. Control Flow (if-else & switch)
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18).
3. Print grade based on marks:
   - 90+ → A
   - 75–89 → B
   - 50–74 → C
   - Below 50 → Fail
4. Use `switch` to print day of the week based on a number (1–7).

---

## 5. Loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Print even numbers from 1 to 20.
3. Print sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
4. Print multiplication table of 5.
5. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.
6. Use a `do...while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

---

## 6. Functions
1. Write a function to print "Hello, World!".
2. Write a function that takes a name as parameter and greets the person.
3. Write a function to add two numbers and return the result.
4. Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.
5. Write a function to find the square of a number.
6. Write a function with default parameter (e.g., greet with default name).

---

## 7. Arrays
1. Create an array of 5 fruits and print it.
2. Access the first and last element of the array.
3. Add a new fruit to the array using `push()`.
4. Remove the last element using `pop()`.
5. Loop through an array and print each element.
6. Find the length of an array.
7. Use `indexOf()` to find position of an element.
8. Sort an array of numbers.

---

## 8. Objects
1. Create an object `student` with properties: name, age, grade.
2. Access object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
3. Add a new property to the object (e.g., city).
4. Change the value of an existing property.
5. Delete a property from the object.
6. Create an object `car` with a method `start()` that prints "Car started!".
7. Create an array of objects (3 students) and print each student’s name.

# JavaScript Hard-Level Practice Questions

This file contains **hard-level problems** for each JavaScript topic. These will help you think deeper and apply logic.

---

## 1. Variables and Declarations
1. Without using a third variable, swap values of three variables: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`.
2. Write a program to swap two numbers using only arithmetic operators (`+` and `-`).
3. Create a program that shows the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` inside nested blocks.

---

## 2. Data Types and Type System
1. What will be the output of: `console.log([] + []);` ? Why?
2. Predict: `console.log([] + {});` and `console.log({} + []);`.
3. Convert a boolean into a number without using `Number()`.
4. Explain why `NaN === NaN` is false. Prove it with code.
5. Write code to safely check if a variable is truly `null`.

---

## 3. Operators
1. Write a program to implement a simple calculator using only operators.
2. Predict output: `console.log(1 < 2 < 3);` and `console.log(3 > 2 > 1);`.
3. Use bitwise operators to check if a number is odd or even.
4. Implement XOR using only `!`, `&&`, and `||`.

---

## 4. Control Flow
1. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers without using `Math.max()`.
2. Write a program to check if a number is prime.
3. Implement a grading system using nested if-else.
4. Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome.
5. Implement a mini password checker:
   - At least 8 characters
   - Contains a number
   - Contains a special character

---

## 5. Loops
1. Print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
2. Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
3. Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a loop.
4. Reverse a number (e.g., 1234 → 4321) using a loop.
5. Find the sum of digits of a number using a loop.
6. Print a pyramid pattern:
   ```
       *
      ***
     *****
    *******
   ```

---

## 6. Functions
1. Write a recursive function to calculate factorial of a number.
2. Write a recursive function to calculate nth Fibonacci number.
3. Implement a function that finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
4. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with only unique values.
5. Write a function that accepts a string and returns the count of each character.

---

## 7. Arrays
1. Write a function to reverse an array without using `reverse()`.
2. Implement bubble sort algorithm in JavaScript.
3. Find the maximum and minimum number in an array without using `Math.max()` or `Math.min()`.
4. Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
5. Rotate an array by `k` positions (e.g., `[1,2,3,4,5]` rotated by 2 → `[4,5,1,2,3]`).
6. Write code to remove duplicates from an array.

---

## 8. Objects
1. Create a `car` object with properties and methods (start, stop, drive). Simulate usage.
2. Write a program to count the frequency of words in a sentence using an object.
3. Merge two objects without using `Object.assign()` or spread operator.
4. Create an object `library` that contains an array of books. Each book has title, author, year. Write a function to find books before year 2000.
5. Write a function that accepts an object and returns all keys whose values are numbers.
6. Implement a simple student management system using an array of objects (add, remove, search student).

✅ These are **challenge-style problems**. Try solving them step by step. If stuck, break the problem into smaller parts.
